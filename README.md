##CivicActions Agile Baseline

The Agile Baseline documents the principles, policies, processes, methods, and tools that underpin the way we do our work. This is a living document and is updated regularly by the CivicActions Agile Champions group.

###How to Use the Baseline

The crux of this documentation is a set of how-to "guides" that describe our process as well as the various methods we use for research, design, implementation, and validation. The **Table of Contents** below provides an overview of the way content is organized in the Baseline. We recommend using this documentation in combination with our [Agile Baseline story map](https://civicactions.storiesonboard.com/m/agile-baseline-story-map), which maps out an ideal Agile project lifecycle.

For examples of fully realized "guides," check out [Sprint Planning Meetings](/03-process/practices/sprint-planning-meetings.md) and [Audiences & Outcomes](/04-methods/1-research/audiences-and-outcomes-guide.md) (we are still developing much of this content).

###How to Contribute

All CivicActions team members are invited to add or edit content in the Baseline. For minor edits, please make the changes in a separate branch and submit a pull request.

We are currently managing the creation of new Baseline content in [Waffle](https://waffle.io/CivicActions/agile-baseline). If you are interested in writing/adding new content, you are welcome to assign yourself to a card from the "Ready" column. Make your changes in a separate branch and submit a pull request when your work is ready to be merged.

Please note: we have created templates for [Practices](/03-process/practices/_template.md), [Methods](/04-methods/_template.md), and [Tools](/05-tools/_tool-template.md). If you are adding a brand new .md file, please use the appropriate template.

If you have questions, ask in [#agile](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/agile/).
